## Puppy Style
Puppy Style is the concept of an app that lets dog owners find other dogs to breed their dogs with to create the perfect breed combination for upcoming puppies. Users can upload all necessary information about their dog and find other dog's information inside the app. With MapKit implementation you can see how far the other dogs live away from yours.
